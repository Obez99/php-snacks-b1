# PHP Snacks

## Setup
I suggest to open a local server using **MAMP** to open ```index.php```.

## Description
Three simple exercises in PHP.

## Exercise 1
This is a very simple form checker, it checks three values passed with GET method.

- **Name** = Must have more than 3 characters.
- **Email** = Must have "@" and "." in it.
- **Age** = Must be a number.

You can pass these values by query string.
```
Example: (yourUrl)/?name=test&email=test@gmail.com&age=18
```

## Exercise 2
This script simply prints a list of posts published in a certain date using two for loops.

## Exercise 3
This script prints a list of random numbers, but won't print the same numbers again.
